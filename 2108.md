https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-palindromic-string-in-the-array/description/

# Intuition
- we have to iterate through each string in the array
- for each we have to check if its a palindrome
# Approach
- we can use StringBuilder.reverse method then compare with original. In this method best and worst case both are O(n).
- write own palindrome checker, where we use a two pointer approach and move from both direction of the string and compare front and last characters. then increment the front and decrement the last pointer. That way gives us a O(n) approach in the worst case. but best case improves to O(1)

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
Assuming O(n)* O(n)

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```
class Solution {
    public String firstPalindrome(String[] words) {
        for (String word: words) {
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
            sb.append(word);
            sb.reverse();
            
            if (Objects.equals(word, sb.toString())) {
                return word;
            }
            
        }
        return "";
    }
}
```
